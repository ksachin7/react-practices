# react-practices

Welcome to my React projects repository!

<!-- ## Summary -->

This repository contains a series of practice projects developed with React to explore and demonstrate different aspects of React development. Key projects in this repository include:

1. **The Wild Oasis**: A hotel management application that features user authentication, cabin and booking management, dashboard analytics, and customization options. It aims to provide a comprehensive solution for both hotel administrators and guests.

2. **Movies**: A Movie Search App that enables users to search for movies, view details, and maintain a watchlist. It utilizes the OMDb API for movie data retrieval.

3. **UI Fundamentals**: A project focused on building reusable UI components with React and styled-components, including support for dark mode. This project also emphasizes unit testing and CI/CD practices to ensure high-quality, maintainable code.

These practice projects are designed to showcase and refine various React skills and techniques.
